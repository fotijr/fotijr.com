I don't have much experience with [React](https://reactjs.org), so I decided to build a market simulator game. This isn't a fully developed game- I just wanted to spend a week learning React and trying out ideas.

Here's how it turned out:
- Try it out [here](https://investorsim.fotijr.com).
- View the [source code](https://github.com/fotijr/investorsim).

## Libraries used
- React
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)- a utility CSS library. Extremely powerful, intuitive, and flexible.
- [Pluralize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pluralize)- a library for pluralizing words, which is a small but enjoyable UX benefit.
- Vite- a speedy development setup (server & builder). I've been a big fan ever since [I first used it](../../2020/spacevg/).
- [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)- Headshots generated by a neural net, which are useful for placeholder profile images.
- Chart.js

### Charting
For charting, I used [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). It's popular, fairly easy to use, and is MIT licensed. I've used it for past projects, and since this was a small part of the app (and not really part of the goal), I didn't consider other options. There is a library that wraps chart.js in an easy to use React component, but I quickly ran into a [bug causing unnecessary re-rendering](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2/issues/729). I wanted my chart to smoothly update like a live stock tracker, so I ended up using Chart.js directly.

## Thoughts on React
I enjoyed working with React. Managing state out of the box was straightforward. I intentionally avoided using Redux since it was overkill for this app (and I've already worked with similar libraries like NgRx and Vuex). My biggest challenge was deciding on the best way to implement certain features. There are many ways to get things done in React (functional vs class components being one example). While this flexibility is great, I can also see it being a challenge in a larger team to enforce consistency.
